        <p>
          Our Team is up and ready to represent you in a way that delightfully
          announces your identity either through online presence or through any

          creatives attuned to the needs of today’s clients.

        <h2>Painting & Drawing</h2>
        <p>
          Grafeex also specializes in painting backdrops, murals, faux
          finishing, and fine arts for churches, schools, residential and
          commercial spaces. We have successfully created a niche in painting,
          in that grafeex work is recognizable for its festive color, attention
          to detail, and often whimsical children's subjects. We have painted
          theater sets, simulating many styles of architecture, stone,
          landscape, and portraiture.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>"Art for All"</b> We believe that every school, church and home is
          a haven and should reflect the passions of its inhabitants; In this
          society, we can help an institution become a unique expression of its
          owners or believers.
        </p>
        <h3>Services offered</h3>
        <p>
          We offer free, in-home design consultation, portfolio review, and
          initial sketches.
        </p>
        <p>
          We custom-design murals or hand-painted subjects in a variety of
          styles, most often painted directly on a client's walls, ceilings,
          furniture, and also as framed fine art.
        </p>
        <p>
          We custom design faux finishes, which are painting techniques that
          imply stone, aging or pattern, while maintaining hand-painted, custom
          color mixing and matching, as opposed to wallpaper or commercially
          mixed and applied pattern and color.
        </p>
        <h3>Production plan</h3>
        <p>
          After receipt of a design fee deposit, grafeex schedules time to
          create painted samples or black and white/color drawn samples,
          according to the agreed and received fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The client is then contacted for an appointment to review samples
          within a couple of weeks, and repeat the design process (for the
          original fee) until the client is happy and agrees to a sample.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grafeex presents a quote and contract for signature—copy for client,
          copy for grafeex, and schedule a begin date, with 70% of the quote due
          as deposit and calendar commitment.
